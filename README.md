# Outer Wilds Discover üöÄ

#### Still WIP

This is a personal project for the incredible game **Outer Wilds**. Since you can only truly experience its mysteries once, many of us enjoy watching _others_ take their first steps into the solar system. This site aims to be a cozy spot to discover new playthroughs (Let's Plays, VODs) to watch!

Built as a portfolio piece to practice and showcase full-stack development with some cool modern tech.
